  "aboutUsFirst": "We are a Siberian Husky Contea Marullo located in Crotone, Calabria, Italy.",
  "aboutUsSecond": "My love for the Siberian Husky breed started with a fateful coincidence. After i graduated college in 2012 i returned to my home country permanently and was looking to adopt a dog. By chance, we came across a blue eyed Siberian Husky that we named Snowball. We started participating in dog shows and researching on the breed standard, long story short the ball started to roll. Until today, we are still active in breeding in a very limited amount and showing actively.",

  "aboutUsThird": "Our mission is to educate everyone about the Siberian Husky breed and ensure the owners of our dogs are equipped with knowledge of the breed. Our dogs are first and foremost our family and pets before they are show dogs.",
  "aboutUsForth": "We have made many wonderful friends by being in this beloved breed.",

  "healthParagraph": "The Siberian Husky is subject to a number of inherited diseases of the eye, including cataracts, corneal dystrophy, progressive retinal atrophy, and glaucoma. Given the wide array of possible eye conditions, regular eye examinations at the veterinarian’s office are in order. Many of these conditions are not treatable, although some may be amenable to surgery. Dogs with progressive retinal atrophy should not be bred. The Siberian Husky can also be prone to epilepsy and seizures. Drugs can be used to control these seizures, and again genetically predisposed dogs should not be used in breeding. Hip Dysplasia is not often found in this breed; however, as with many medium or larger-sized canines, it can occur. The Orthopedic Foundation of Animals currently has the Siberian Husky ranked 155th out of a possible 160 breeds at risk for hip dysplasia, with only two percent of tested Siberian Huskies showing dysplasia.",
  "groomingParagraph": "Unlike many breeds the Siberian Husky has retained its original naturally functional coat. As a result the husky coat needs very minimal grooming. Brushing about twice a week will remove any loose hairs and provide an opportunity to check for fleas etc. Generally huskies require very little bathing unless they have gotten particularly dirty, usually a few times a year is sufficient. The main challenge with a huskies coat is dealing with shedding. Huskies have a double coat of hair, an undercoat and an outer coat. Approximately twice a year, depending on your climate, a husky will blow or shed its undercoat. This can last for about three weeks or more and a huge quantity of hair is lost in this time. The hair falls out in clumps, sometimes large clumps and so daily brushing is required to remove the hair that is falling out. The shedding will usually start on the legs and thighs and then progress the body and finish up with the britches and tail area. Sometimes a warm bath can help to loosen up hair during shedding season and make it easier to brush out. Do not underestimate the amount of fur that will be lost during a huskies shedding. If you do not want hairs on your furniture, clothes etc. then a husky is not the right breed for you.",
  "defectParagraph": "Any deviation must be considered a defect, and the severity with which it is considered is exactly proportional to its gravity.",
  "chukiHistoryFirst": "It is the Chukchi tribe that is credited with the origination of the Siberian Husky. The Chukchi tribe inhabited the part of Siberia closest to Alaska and the harsh weather conditions along with the necessity to transport food and goods over a long distance led to the beginning of the sled dog. The Siberian Husky which at that time was known as the Siberian Chukchi was bred for endurance to cover the long distances rather than for speed. They had to be energy efficient so that they could perform their task with as little effort as possible.The friendly nature of the breed also stems from the Chuckchi as the dogs were primarily cared for by the women and children of the tribe on a daily basis and thus they adapted to family life.",
  "chukiHistorySecond": "It was in 1908 that a Russian fur trader named Goosak brought a group of huskies still known as Chukch is to Alaska. His purpose was to enter the All-Alaska Sweepstakes sled dog race which was a 657km race in which he was placed third. Following this race, a man named Fox Maule Ramsay chartered a boat to Siberia and returned with over 60 of the best dogs he could find. In the third All-Alaska Sweepstakes two of Ramsay’s teams placed first and second. The dogs brought in by Ramsay came to form the foundation of what is known today as the Siberian Husky.",

  "chukiHistoryThird": "In 1925 an outbreak of diphtheria in Nome, Alaska led to the great serum run during which teams of sled dogs transported the anti-toxin from Nenana, Alaska to Nome, Alaska. Thanks to the sled dogs the serum was delivered in time. One person who became especially known from the run was Leonard Seppala who used a team of huskies. Seppala was the first to introduce Siberian Huskies to the United States outside of Alaska and helped to establish the breed in the eastern United States through his own breeding programmes and his dogs became the foundation stock for other breeders, and so the breed began.",

    "headText": "Skull region: medium-sized skull, proportionate to the body; slightly rounded on top and narrowing from the widest point to the eyes. Well-defined stop. Muzzle region: black nose in gray-fawn or black dogs, liver in copper-colored dogs; it may be flesh-colored in entirely white dogs. Accepted the pink streaked nose “snow nose”. Muzzle of medium length and width, tapers gradually towards the nose, with neither pointed nor square end. The nasal bridge is straight from the stop to the tip of the nose. Well-pigmented and very tight lips. Jaws - Teeth: scissor closure. Eyes: almond-shaped, moderately spaced and slightly oblique. The eyes can be brown or blue; heterochromia is allowed. Penetrating but friendly expression, interested and never malicious. Ears: medium-sized, triangular, close together and set high on the head. They are thick, well-furred, slightly arched in the back and standing erect with slightly rounded tips pointing upwards.",
    "neckTitle": "NECK",
    "neckText": "Medium length, arched and proudly carried erect in stance. In movement, at a trot, the neck is extended so that the head is carried slightly forward.",
    "bodyTitle": "BODY",
    "bodyText": "Back straight and strong, with a horizontal topline from the withers to the croup. Medium length, neither “cobby” nor slack because excessively long. Loin tense and dry, narrower than the chest, and slightly retracted. Croup sloped relative to the spine, but never so hollowed to limit the thrust of the hindquarters. Chest deep and strong but not too broad, with the lowest point at the elbow level. The ribs are well sprung near the spine but flattened on the sides to allow free movement.",
    "tailTitle": "TAIL",
    "tailText": "Rich, brush-like fox tail, set just below the level of the topline and carried on the back in a graceful sickle curve when the dog is attentive. When carried high it does not curl on the sides nor flattens on the back. For the resting dog a low tail is normal. The hair of the tail is of medium length, and about the same length above, on the sides and below, with the appearance of a round brush.",
    "foreLimbsTitle": "FORE LIMBS",
    "foreLimbsText": "In stance, and viewed from the front, the limbs are moderately spaced, parallel and straight. The bone is of substance but never heavy. The length of the limbs from the elbow to the ground is slightly greater than the distance from the elbow to the tip of the withers. The forelimb spurs may be removed. Shoulder and arm: the scapula is well sloped. Arm slightly slanted back from the tip of the shoulder to the elbow, and is never perpendicular to the ground. The muscles and ligaments between the shoulder and the rib cage are firm and well developed. Elbows: close to the body and not deviated outward or inward. Carpus: strong, but flexible. Metacarpi: viewed from the side are slightly inclined.",
    "hindLimbsTitle": "HIND LIMBS",
    "hindLimbsText": "In stance, viewed from behind, the hind limbs are moderately spaced and parallel. The spurs, if any, must be removed. Thigh: very muscular and powerful. Knee: well angled. Hock: well defined and lowered.",
    "feetTitle": "FEET",

    "gaitTitle": "GAIT",
    "gaitText": "The characteristic movement of the Siberian Husky is smooth and without obvious effort. It's quick and light, and in the ring, it should be led with a loose leash at a moderately fast trot, showing good extension of the forelimbs and good drive of the hind limbs. If seen from the front, at a walk, the Siberian Husky doesn't proceed on a single-track, but as the speed increases, the limbs gradually incline until the footprints fall on the line of the body's longitudinal axis. When the footprints converge, the fore and hind limbs move straight forward, without elbows or knees deviating out or in. Each of the hind limbs moves on the track of the forelimb on the same side. As the dog moves, the dorsal line remains steady and horizontal.",
    "coatTitle": "COAT",
    "coatText": "The fur of the Siberian Husky is double and medium-length, giving an appearance of a rich coat, but never so long as to obscure the clear profile of the dog. The undercoat is soft and dense and of sufficient length to support the covering fur. The guard hair of the covering coat is straight and rather leaning on the body, never rough or bristled. It should be noted that the absence of undercoat during the molting period is normal. It is allowed to trim the whiskers and the fur between the toes and around the feet to allow a more tidy appearance; grooming the fur on any other part of the body is not allowed and should be severely penalized. Color: All colors from black to pure white are allowed. A variety of spots on the head of different types are noted, including various patterns not found in other breeds.",
    "sizeTitle": "SIZE-WEIGHT",
