    text: "Siberian Husky tails are heavily furred; these dogs will often curl up with their tails over their faces and noses in order to provide additional warmth. When curled up to sleep the Siberian Husky will cover its nose for warmth, often referred to as the “Siberian Swirl”. The tail should be expressive, held low when the dog is relaxed, and curved upward in a “sickle” shape when excited or interested in something.",

Females are smaller, growing to between 19 to 23 inches (48 to 58cm) tall at the withers and weighing between 35 to 50 pounds (16 to 23kg)",

    title: "COAT",
    text: "A Siberian Husky has a double coat that is thicker than that of most other dog breeds. It has two layers: a dense, finely wavy undercoat and a longer topcoat of thicker, straight guard hairs. It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, and also reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low as −50 to −60°C. The undercoat is often absent during shedding. Their thick coats require weekly grooming. An excessively long coat, sometimes referred to as a “wooly”/“woolie” or “long haired” coat, is considered a fault by the breed’s standard as it lacks the thicker protection of the standard coat’s guard hairs, obscures the dog’s clear-cut outline, causes quicker overheating during serious harness work, and becomes easily matted and encrusted with snow and ice. Siberian Huskies come in a variety  of colors and patterns often with white paws and legs, facial markings, and tail tip. Example coat colors are black and white, copper-red and white, grey and white, pure white, and agouti coat, though many individuals have blondish or piebald spotting. Some other individuals also have the “saddle back” pattern, in which black-tipped guard hairs are restricted to the saddle area while the head, haunches and shoulders are either light red or white. Striking masks, spectacles, and other facial markings occur in wide variety.All coat colors from black to pure white are allowed. Merle coat patterns are not permitted. This pattern is often associated with health issues and mixed breeding.",
